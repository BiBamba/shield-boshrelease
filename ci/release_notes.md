## Major version v7

NOTE: Please ignore v7.0.0 which was accidentally cut and is a duplicate of v6.9.0. v7.0.1 is the first release of v7.

v7 is the first release of SHIELD BOSH release to drastically simplify deployment using BOSH v2 (`bosh2` CLI), Credentials generation using `bosh2` or Credhub, Cloud Config, Links and other loveliness.

See https://github.com/starkandwayne/shield-boshrelease/pull/76 for background to this major version.

NOTE: There are no upgrade docs from v6 to v7 yet. If you do go thru the upgrade process and survive, please help us to write some documentation or blog posts, thanks!
